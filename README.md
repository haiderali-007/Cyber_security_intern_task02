# 🔐 Network Security & Scanning Project

This project was completed as part of the **ApexPlanet Network Security Module**.  
It focuses on practical implementation of reconnaissance, scanning, vulnerability assessment, packet analysis, and firewall configuration.

---

## 🚀 Objectives
- Learn reconnaissance and network mapping.
- Perform port and service scanning using **Nmap**.
- Detect vulnerabilities using **OpenVAS**.
- Capture and analyze network packets with **Wireshark**.
- Implement **firewall rules** to block unauthorized access.

---

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies Used
- 🛰️ **Nmap** – Port & Service Scanning  
- 🧱 **OpenVAS** – Vulnerability Assessment  
- 🧩 **Wireshark** – Packet Analysis  
- ⚙️ **hping3** – SYN Flood Simulation  
- 🔥 **iptables** – Firewall Configuration

## 🧩 Key Tasks Performed
1. **Reconnaissance:** Whois, Nslookup, Google Dorking, Shodan  
2. **Port Scanning:** Nmap TCP/UDP, Version Detection, OS Detection  
3. **Vulnerability Scanning:** OpenVAS setup and analysis of results  
4. **Packet Analysis:** Capture HTTP, FTP, DNS traffic using Wireshark  
5. **Firewall Configuration:** Created iptables rules to block port scan attempts
